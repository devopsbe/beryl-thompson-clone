            I have spent my adult years figuring out what happened in my life and why. I found, along the way, that Earth is a planet of free will; however, that certainly had not been my experience. I wondered how reputable people could be making such claims? I felt tortured. Such a powerful claim … that couldn't possibly be true! I kept seeking. Turns out, that's the key ... <em className="text-primary dark:text-primary-light">keep seeking</em>.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            So, if everything is, indeed, for our highest good and continued seeking is a part of free will/intent, the result must be the journey. And, after nearly 60 years, I can say that this journey has consistently taken me to more and more of mySelf. It is advertised that space is the final frontier. What if the Journey to the Self is our first "assignment" and all else can be added from that vantage point? What if free will and intent cause the quality of the experience we end up having?
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6 text-center italic font-medium">
            That got my attention.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6 text-center text-xl font-bold text-primary dark:text-primary-light">
            Evidently, choice is our greatest power!

          <p className="mb-6">
            Direction-of-out is how we are initially trained for the world. Direction-of-in is how we finally learn the truth of ourSelves and our purpose. The direction-of-out, which processes through the ego/intellect, utilizes the characteristics of shame, blame, judgment, guilt and punishment. Direction-of-in utilizes the whole of ourSelves, activated through the heart center as the processor. The characteristics of this routing are:

            <p className="text-xl font-medium text-primary dark:text-primary-light mb-2">
              Being real/authentic, Integrity, Respect, Truth and Honor

          </div>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            When there are reports in the media of integrity, respect, truth or honor, it is about an individual choosing to be their authentic Self in the midst of any circumstances, exercising their free will. You can feel it. You can actually feel that person's experience inside your own chest and body. I say that our feelings are guideposts and when interpreted correctly, we find our way in life and we get our needs met.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            That's why I live and teach the Journey to the Self. It is simply empowering. Everyone who chooses to, changes their lives, one choice at a time, toward thriving. I feel that it's a process of self-ownership. That's consciousness … and ultimately joy!

        <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-center text-secondary dark:text-white">Highest Good</h2>
        
        <div className="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert mx-auto text-secondary-light dark:text-gray-300">
          <p className="mb-6">
            There are many sources for the maxim that says "Everything is for our highest good." What if that is absolutely true? What if it's all in the lens or perception … the eye of the beholder? What if life itself is for the purpose of realizing that that is indeed true? What if that is the beginning position that ultimately leads to the joy of becoming conscious?
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            It seems to begin from that knowing, that we are each a unique expression of the energy that is life itself? (Most of us call that energy God or the Universe or Source or Great Spirit.) Evidently, when we begin from that understanding of ourSelves, it causes a different perspective within us. Just that one shift makes all the difference.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            My experience within mySelf (and with others) consistently supports that this is the key to a different life experience. What if life is an opportunity to practice that lens? And with practice, it becomes the Journey … to the Self. It seems to start inside the center of your chest. Even children can feel it. When we begin from there, we have a different quality of life than when we don't.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            So, that's the starting point - the center of the chest. And you can't get there from the head. It's a conscious choice to step inside ourSelves. There are feelings inside there … and consciousness. It's a definite shift from the head and intellect. Practice. See for yourSelf. It's a different space. It's like the ego and intellect run the exterior of our bodies – how we land in the world - survival. Then the heart center runs the interior, our Beings, which seems to be how we learn navigation, determining how we experience the world - thriving.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Even though we are each unique, there are similarities within the human race. The center of the chest is the entry point. The rest is experiential. With a guide, the journey can be streamlined, even fun. Fulfilling your birthright is what life is for. You just have to learn how.

          <p className="mb-6">
            We each have a unique blueprint. Even twins are not exactly alike. I suspect that we "design" ourselves when we are creating our lives and work to fulfill that design during that lifetime. Any progress we make causes us to experience ourselves closer and closer to that blueprint. I describe the experience as a process of "docking." When you take the time to reflect on it, it looks and feels like a slow process of becoming the truth of our Self which causes a deepening or landing within our Self … one choice at a time … energy meeting form. The Journey to the Self encourages us, each time, to make choices that resonate with our authentic blueprint and not the imprint that we have been trained in.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            The key is intention. That's what makes choice work. Then, the quality of the intention is important. Is the intention born from the ego/intellect or the heart center? There's choice again and degrees of choice. Each experience becomes a part of the tapestry that is life, which is a very personal recipe indeed.
